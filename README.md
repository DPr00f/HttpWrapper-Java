SteamKit-Java
=============
SteamKit-Java, is a java port of a library written for interfacing directly with various parts of the Steam network.

The major connection functionality exists, but there are plenty of functions I haven't tested yet.

You must include bouncycastle as a dependency to allow encryption of the packets.
